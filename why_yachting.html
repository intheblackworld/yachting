During the long weekend, you and a few girlfriends have planned an exclusive small journey. Since time is rather short, you are reluctant to waste even one second of it, therefore you and your friends wake up on time in the early morning to watch sunrise. In the morning, everyone is busy looking for signs of cetaceans in the ocean and in the afternoon, you and your girlfriends spend time preparing for tea in the galley, secretly competing to see who makes the best desserts. After that, it is time for tea, sightseeing and chatting about the yesteryears and the future. At last, the golden halo of the sun submerges into the ocean at dusk and everyone starts to prepare the night’s feast in a leisurely, laidback fashion.

The older you get, the more you loathe being bound by limitations. The genes of adventure in you constantly push you to search for new challenges, therefore you learned how to free dive. During the weekends, you always hop aboard your yacht to unknown destinations. Wherever you feel like it and if the scenery feels right, you jump into the water to explore. You love spontaneous adventures like this and you are overwhelmed with a sense of achievement because you have been able to increase your diving time.

It’s nothing special really, you just feel annoyed by the mountain of work to be done. Why not take to the seas? Loiter around on deck doing absolutely nothing for a while to relax, letting the slightly salty sea breeze take away all my troubles. A seagull looks at me curiously and becomes startled by splashes of water. I cannot help but laugh out loud and all my worries vanish into thin air.</div>

<div class="why_text" ><div style="font-weight: bold;">Partying with my friends wherever, whenever, no matter how noisy or how drunk we can get:</div>
We all agreed to spend my 40th birthday together. To my surprise, all my college buddies actually turned up for the celebration. We drink and chat about the embarrassing and interesting things from yesteryears. The young guns at the time are now middle aged men, yet when we get together, we feel like we are 20-year olds again. Feeling a little tipsy, a couple of them start dancing on the deck, and I can’t help but sing a song to commemorate our bygone youth.

The client is notoriously difficult to deal with, always putting on a stern face that makes him rather unapproachable. Therefore in order to bridge the distance between us, I make up an excuse and invited him onboard the yacht for a visit. To my surprise, he agreed in an instant. After boarding the yacht, he even chatted with me enthusiastically about the boat’s interior and design. After checking that he has a clear schedule for the rest of the day, I invited him to join me at sea. Subsequently, his attitude became much mellower and we now have endless topics to talk about besides official business.

The two sisters don their life vests gleefully and curiously ask about everything regarding the seemingly endless ocean. “Do shrimps have to sleep too?” “Where are the starfish? I want to see the starfish”. My wife and I try to answer their questions one by one with a smile, albeit there are times when we are both stumped for an answer. I wonder if they will remember their childhood passion for the ocean when they grow up ten years from now. Looking at the smiles on their innocent faces, I reckon it won’t matter even if they don’t remember.

We both love to socialize and after deducting the time spent with friends, we don’t seem to have much time left for ourselves. For me, to be able to take to the sea like this occasionally and admire the picturesque scenery is pure bliss. There is no need to do too much talking, just spending some quality time alone in the company of each other.</div>

Whenever I travel far away from home, my biggest concern is where to leave my furry child. Ever since I purchased the boat, I finally no longer have to worry about that, but I never dreamt that my furry child would love the ocean as much as I do. Often he would get himself wet and deliberately shake off water next to me before staring at me with those big innocent eyes as if I am stupid enough to fall for his prank. </div>

      <div class="why_text"><div style="font-weight: bold;">Sudden urge to unwind – Wander around on the deck and let the sea breeze caress my face to take away my bad mood:</div>
It’s nothing special really, you just feel annoyed by the mountain of work to be done. Why not take to the seas? Loiter around on deck doing absolutely nothing for a while to relax, letting the slightly salty sea breeze take away all my troubles. A seagull looks at me curiously and becomes startled by splashes of water. I cannot help but laugh out loud and all my worries vanish into thin air.

      <div class="why_text" style=""><div style="font-weight: bold;">Partying with my friends wherever, whenever, no matter how noisy or how drunk we can get:</div>
We all agreed to spend my 40th birthday together. To my surprise, all my college buddies actually turned up for the celebration. We drink and chat about the embarrassing and interesting things from yesteryears. The young guns at the time are now middle aged men, yet when we get together, we feel like we are 20-year olds again. Feeling a little tipsy, a couple of them start dancing on the deck, and I can’t help but sing a song to commemorate our bygone youth.

          <div class="why_text"><div style="word-spacing: -2px; font-weight: bold;">Drawing clients and business partners closer – Take a cruise on the yacht to smooth out the negotiation process:</div>
The client is notoriously difficult to deal with, always putting on a stern face that makes him rather unapproachable. Therefore in order to bridge the distance between us, I make up an excuse and invited him onboard the yacht for a visit. To my surprise, he agreed in an instant. After boarding the yacht, he even chatted with me enthusiastically about the boat’s interior and design. After checking that he has a clear schedule for the rest of the day, I invited him to join me at sea. Subsequently, his attitude became much mellower and we now have endless topics to talk about besides official business.

        <div class="why_text"><div style="font-weight: bold;">Taking the whole family to a secret getaway – a different destination every time:</div>
The two sisters don their life vests gleefully and curiously ask about everything regarding the seemingly endless ocean. “Do shrimps have to sleep too?” “Where are the starfish? I want to see the starfish”. My wife and I try to answer their questions one by one with a smile, albeit there are times when we are both stumped for an answer. I wonder if they will remember their childhood passion for the ocean when they grow up ten years from now. Looking at the smiles on their innocent faces, I reckon it won’t matter even if they don’t remember.

        <div class="why_text"><div style="font-weight: bold;">Sometimes I just want to be alone with my better half – Take a romantic cruise on the yacht:</div>
We both love to socialize and after deducting the time spent with friends, we don’t seem to have much time left for ourselves. For me, to be able to take to the sea like this occasionally and admire the picturesque scenery is pure bliss. There is no need to do too much talking, just spending some quality time alone in the company of each other.

        <div class="why_text"><div style="font-weight: bold;">Afraid that your “furry kids” are bored? Take them on the yacht to have some fun:</div>
Whenever I travel far away from home, my biggest concern is where to leave my furry child. Ever since I purchased the boat, I finally no longer have to worry about that, but I never dreamt that my furry child would love the ocean as much as I do. Often he would get himself wet and deliberately shake off water next to me before staring at me with those big innocent eyes as if I am stupid enough to fall for his prank.
